## Selected Solutions to Coding Assignments of the 2018 edition of Statistical Learning Theory at ETH Zurich

This repo contains the solutions to the following coding assignments:
* Locally Linear Embedding (slt-ce-1.ipynb)
* MCMC sampling methods (slt-ce-2.ipynb)
* Meanfield Approximation for Image Denoising (slt-ce-7.ipynb)

For every assignment algorithms from assigned papers were implemented. Each notebook contains a summary of the theory, implementation of the algorithm as well as an analysis.
